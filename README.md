# drunken-debauchery
To practice creating different story formats, I whipped up a redesign of an article I wrote for <a href="statenews.com">The State News</a>.

The article, 'Drunken debauchery': A look back at Michigan State's 1999 riot, tells the story of how a massive riot unfolded 20 years prior. It was an emotional and powerful story, so it was important for me to reflect that in its presentation. Using photos from the newspaper's archives, an interactive story map I created and CSS, I try to encourage the reader to consider what it was like to be a witness to the chaos.

## Outcome
Examining code is great, but you should also see this thing in action. <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/madisonoconn/drunken-debauchery/08b285d4adcb57e13ed03179f515287ca291a0ef/1999-riot-redesign.html">See it here</a>.

## Project status
I'm still toying with the way the story is presented, especially on mobile. Stay tuned.
